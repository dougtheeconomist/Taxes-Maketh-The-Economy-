# Taxation And Economic Health

On my last trip through Minnesota I visited with a good friend of mine who is a resident there and in discussing the local economy(which happens to be quite strong) he asserted the theory that this strength comes from the fact that Minnesota has one of the highest tax rates in the U.S. and that the public suport that these taxes fund creates an environment that is conducive to economic prosperity. I had also read a book published by several political scientists that positted the same theory at the time, so in my mind this theory is a valid one to consider. It does however run counter to one that many make in arguing the case for lower taxes; that policy should focus not on building up an environment in which business can thrive, but instead lowering the costs of operating a business in as much as possible by lowering their tax burden. 

So in this study I aim to look at state level data in order empirically say which theory(if either) actually holds weight. To accomplish this goal I collect and merge data published by the federal government by way of the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as the Bureaus of Economic Analysis and labor statistics, to form a dataset on which hypothesis testing can be performed to answer this question.
