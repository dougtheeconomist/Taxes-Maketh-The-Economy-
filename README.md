# Taxation And Economic Health

During my last trip through Minnesota I visited with a good friend of mine who is a resident there and in discussing the local economy(which happens to be quite strong) he asserted the theory that this strength comes from the fact that Minnesota has one of the highest tax rates in the U.S. and that the public support that these taxes fund creates an environment that is conducive to economic prosperity. I had also read a book published by several political scientists that posited the same theory at the time, so in my mind this theory is a valid one to consider. It does however run counter to one that many make in arguing the case for lower taxes; that policy should focus not on building up an environment in which business can thrive, but instead lowering the costs of operating a business in as much as possible by lowering their tax burden. 

So in this study I aim to look at state level data in order empirically say which theory (if either) actually holds weight. In order to accomplish this goal, I collect and merge data published by the federal government by way of the U.S. Census Bureau, as well as the Bureaus of Economic Analysis and labor statistics, to form a dataset on which hypothesis testing can be performed to answer this question.

# Methodology

In order to effectively examine the relationship between taxation and economic health I need data on economic indicators and taxation levels. In assessing the economic health of an area I turn to the indicators of the gross domestic product and unemployment rate of a given state. I also gather demographic information on population levels to serve as a measure of the size of a state as I expect that the overall size of the economy in question to be a factor that would bias my results if not taken into account; one would reasonably expect California to have higher GDP and tax income that Rhode Island. The first hurdle to overcome conceptually in order to effectively shed light on this issue is the fact that the amount of revenue brought in from taxes will be directly dependent upon the size of GDP and for states that have income taxes, the size and percentage employed of the areas workforce. What I want to measure is the other factor that directly impacts tax revenue size, which is the actual state tax rate. The way I control for the first factor to isolate the different rate of taxation between states is to collect data on federal tax revenue from each state in addition to collecting a state's tax revenue. The assumption I explicitly make is that the rate that the federal government taxes each state is going to be the same. Therefore by comparing the state's collections to the federal government's collection from the same area, we can get a comparable measure of how much more one state taxes its populace than another. I form this measure of taking the ration of state revenue to federal revenue. The higher this ratio is, the higher the states tax rates are compared to the federal tax rates, which are assumed to be the same across all state. 

This assumption may not be perfectly accurate to the real world, in reality there is some difference between the industries and types of business entities that generate income from one state to another, and if these industries are taxed differently which I suspect they may be, then the effective federal tax rate would vary some by state. For this study, I am content to make this assumption, because I believe that this variation will be negligible, but a direction of further study would be to group states with like industries and to then compare across these sub-groups to mitigate any bias that this may introduce into my analysis.
